            <p>I love exploring and learning new things. The web development sources given by the coding club brought me
                fire to begin my coding journey. I earlier started started coding with C++ language but web devlopment
                seemed much interesting.</p>

            <p class="yo">My deep interests include photography and finance. My hobbies include sketching and gaming. I love
                workingout in the gym which acts as a stress reliever. That's it for now peeps :). Thank you!! </p>
